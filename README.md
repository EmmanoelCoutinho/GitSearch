This is an web application that lists your repositories on github, made using Typescript, styled-components and React.

## How to use?

<h2>Frist of all:</h2>

### `Yarn`

to get all the dependencies that were used in this project, you can check them in the package.json,

<h2>Now, the environment variables:</h2>

In this project i used two environment variables, and you have two options about that:

<h3>`Frist:`</h3>
You can go to the github api documentation and make your own keys, after that create a .env file at the root of the project and write:<br/>
 REACT_APP_GITHUB_PUBLIC= your_public_key;<br/>
 REACT_APP_GITHUB_SECRET= your_secret_key;

<h3>`Second:`</h3>
You can just delete the environment variables, which are called in the app.tsx, remove them from fetch and useEffect as well and it should work (the first is more advisable! ^^)
